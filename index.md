# About Me
I hold first class degrees and more in innovative, and cutting-edge technologies. Including a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Games Programming, Master’s degree in Virtual Reality (VR), and bootcamps in AI and Unreal Engine. These have equipped me with both the theoretical, practical, and soft skills needed to create immersive experiences. I work well with others in teams, even leading them, and actively seek to support and communicate with fellows on projects or aspiring students in the field at tech conferences I go to often.

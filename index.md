# About Me
I hold first class degrees and more in innovative, and cutting-edge technologies. Including a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Games Programming, Master’s degree in Virtual Reality (VR), and bootcamps in AI and Unreal Engine. These have equipped me with both the theoretical, practical, and soft skills needed to create immersive experiences. I work well with others in teams, even leading them, and actively seek to support and communicate with fellows on projects or aspiring students in the field at tech conferences I go to often.

# Unannounced Media Project Made With Unreal Engine 5's Niagara VFXUnannounced Media Project Made With Unreal Engine 5's Niagara VFX

        ## Outline:
        Worked as a team lead, liaising with clients, other teams, and created individual bespoke systems of particle effects using Unreal Engine 5s Niagara visual effects system along with blueprints visual scripting to make assets and deliverables inline with clients in the media sector for an unannounced project. The team was highly praised, and the client appreciated the final results of each of the unique systems.

        ### Key responsibilities:
        • Team management, which involved organizing meetings with the team members to go over allocating the development of assets (visual effect systems in Unreal Engine 5) and assisting in whichever issues team members were facing. Managing was done via emails, video calling, text and Miro boards.
        • Talking with the client, stakeholders, and other teams to manage which assets and deliverable were required, including pitching our own ideas, and cross-team collaboration with assets.
        • Creating my own particles systems outside which other systems were being made by the other team members, done in Unreal Engine 5 with their visual effects and visual coding systemsOutline: Worked as a team lead, liaising with clients, other teams, and created individual bespoke systems of particle effects using Unreal Engine 5s Niagara visual effects system along with blueprints visual scripting to make assets and deliverables inline with clients in the media sector for an unannounced project.

# C++ OpenGL SFML Game EngineC++ OpenGL SFML Game Engine

        ## Outline:
        Created a working generic C++ game engine via the use of OpenGL, SFML and shaders to render and draw out a scene that could load in .obj models and textures, read data from .xml files via a .xml loader (TinyXML), designed with strong class inheritance using the factory design pattern, in a group. The game created was a simple adventure game where you controlled a bee finding honey.

        ### Key responsibilities:
        • Creating content for the game engine which allowed additional gameplay features for the main game and handling scene transitions.
        • Creating the UI of the game for the various game scenes such as the main menu, options, and main game via the use of original artwork and handling the buttons in the UI elements.
        • Working with other members of the group to delegate work for the project and to maintain the GitHub repository and fix bugs.Outline: Created a working generic C++ game engine via the use of OpenGL, SFML and shaders to render and draw out a scene that could load in .obj models and textures, read data from .xml files via a .xml loader (TinyXML), designed with strong class inheritance using the factory design pattern, in a group.

# Mixed Reality HeadsetMixed Reality Headset

        ## Outline:
        Created a mixed reality (MR) headset, designed and ran experiments with participants, tested interactions in MR. The headset was constructed from a virtual reality headset, a 3D stereo camera and LEAP Motion camera. The video input was processed with the game engine Unity, which was used to make the experiment. Participants were brought in for 45 minute time slots to test interactions in MR and processed.

        ### Key responsibilities
         • Created a literature review, researching the history of VR and MR, evaluating devices and software that would work best together (headset, pass-through, hand tracking) to make the MR headset. 
         • Using Unity to create an experiment to test user interactions in MR. Using the stereo camera to overlay virtual objects into the real world, using filters to change perspectives of users in dexterity based tasks. 
         • Finding and onboarding users for the experiment, found via Call For Participants. Organizing the schedule and time slots. Guiding users through the experiment in person, noting user data throughout.Outline Created a mixed reality (MR) headset, designed and ran experiments with participants, tested interactions in MR.

# Projection Mapping with MannequinsProjection Mapping with Mannequins

        ## Outline:
        Successfully designed the first projection mapping system using a laser projector. Used 3D character models rigged in a suitable environment (Unity) onto a physical mannequin via a laser projector, with animations taken from an actor's face via an Intel RealSense camera in real-time in collaboration with other people of the group. This is the first project in this field to use a laser projector in a project.

        ### Key responsibilities:
         • Creating the 3D assets required to project onto the mannequin, including the 3D models themselves and facial animations.
         • Creating “pre-baked” animations inside Unity which used key-frames and morphs to manipulate any compatible 3D model created with the same predefined morphs.
         • Organizing the work of each member of the group, communicating clearly what is needed, and which potential issues may arise, maintaining the GitHub repository, and debugging code / pull requests.Outline: Successfully designed the first projection mapping system using a laser projector.

# Universal, Audio Driven Beginner Friendly VR ProjectUniversal, Audio Driven Beginner Friendly VR Project

        ## Outline:
        In this project, a virtual reality experience in Unreal Engine was created via the use of an Oculus headset and Leap Motion controller for users with no prior virtual reality experience. They were introduced to core concepts of virtual reality at their own pace. It was designed as a universal experience where the user is directed by sound and curiosity rather than UI and text, removing language barriers and naturally flows.

        ### Key responsibilities:
        • Designing a virtual reality experience that would be suitable for people who have never used virtual reality before, and for anyone in all walks of life and languages.
        • Creating a virtual reality experience in Unreal Engine via the use of Unreal’s own Blueprint visual scripting language and C++.
        • Implementing suitable and comfortable interaction methods in a VR space that would allow people of different mobility levels to interact in the VR space without nausea or discomfort.Outline: In this project, a virtual reality experience in Unreal Engine was created via the use of an Oculus headset and Leap Motion controller for users with no prior virtual reality experience.
